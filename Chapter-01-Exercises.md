1.  For cases 3 and 4 in section 1.5, list the possible predictor
    variables that might be useful assuming relevant data is available
    -   3: car mileage, make/model, condition, average distance of
        trips, car color, accidents
    -   4: number of airlines, airplane model type, or even \# of seats
        available if a supply side issue. Quarterly or seasonal data,
        holiday / sporting event calendar by hub for demand.

        needed data
    3.  Prelim analysis: ….you would analyze the data
    4.  Choosing and fitting models: … and choose the best model which
        sounds more like a linear regression and less like a time series
        for this problem
    5.  Using and evaluating a model: if a time series problem, use the
        data you have to back test
